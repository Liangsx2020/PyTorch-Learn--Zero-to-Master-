# üìñ My PyTorch Learning Notes

Welcome to my PyTorch learning notes repository! This project aims to record my entire learning process following [Zero to Mastery Learn PyTorch for Deep Learning](https://www.learnpytorch.io/) to learn PyTorch.

Through this repository, I hope to:
- **Systematically organize** core concepts and code encountered during the learning process
- **Consolidate knowledge** through practice and note-taking to deepen understanding
- **Record growth**, showcasing my learning trajectory from beginner to proficient in PyTorch
- **Share and communicate**, hoping to provide some reference for friends who are also learning PyTorch

## üöÄ Learning Resources

* **Main Tutorial (blog)**Ôºö[Zero to Mastery Learn PyTorch for Deep Learning](https://www.learnpytorch.io/)
* **Github Resource**Ôºö[PyTorch Documentation](https://github.com/mrdbourke/pytorch-deep-learning)

## üõ†Ô∏è Setup & Installation

To successfully reproduce all the notes and code in this project, please follow these steps to set up your local environment.

### 1. Clone Repository

First, clone this repository to your local machine:
```bash
git clone [https://github.com/Liangsx2020/PyTorch-Learn--Zero-to-Master-](https://github.com/Liangsx2020/PyTorch-Learn--Zero-to-Master-)
cd PyTorch-Learn--Zero-to-Master-
```

### 2. Create and Activate Virtual Environment

We strongly recommend using a Python virtual environment to manage project dependencies to avoid conflicts with other projects on your system.

* **Create virtual environment and install dependencies** (recommended name: `pytorch_ZTM`):
    ```bash
    conda create -n pytorch_ZTM python=3.11

    conda activate pytorch_ZTM

    pip install requirements.txt

    ```
    The `-r` parameter tells `pip` to read and install the package list from the specified file.

Now, your environment is ready and you can start learning and running the code in the project!
